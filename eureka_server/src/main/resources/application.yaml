  client:
    # 1. Disable client registration:
    # The server should NOT register itself with a registry (since it IS the registry)
    register-with-eureka: false

    # 2. Disable fetching the registry:
    # The server should NOT try to fetch the registry from peers (unless running in HA mode)
    fetch-registry: false

    # 3. Define the Service URL (Best Practice)
    # Even though we disabled client behavior, it's good practice to set the URL
    # to avoid log warnings/errors about not finding peers. It points to itself.
